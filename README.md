# 📊 Supply Chain Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization
**Power BI | SQL | Supply Chain Analytics**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on solving a critical supply chain business problem — **inaccurate demand forecasting** — using data analysis and visualization.  
The goal is to help organizations reduce **stock-outs, excess inventory, and revenue loss** by improving demand visibility across SKUs, products, and locations.

---

## 🚨 Business Problem
The organization experienced frequent inventory mismatches due to inaccurate demand forecasts across different **SKUs and geographic locations**.

### Key Challenges
- Overstocking of low-demand products leading to higher holding costs  
- Stock-outs of high-demand products causing lost sales  
- Lack of visibility into **seasonal demand patterns**  
- Demand variation across locations without customized forecasting  

These issues negatively impacted **inventory planning, supply chain efficiency, and customer satisfaction**.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
To analyze historical sales and inventory data in order to:
- Identify demand patterns and seasonality  
- Detect forecast gaps (under-forecasting and over-forecasting)  
- Support better inventory, production, and supply planning decisions  

---

## 📂 Data Used
- Product Type, SKU  
- Number of Products Sold  
- Revenue Generated  
- Customer Demographics  
- Location  
- Availability and Stock Levels  

---

## 🛠️ How the Problem Was Solved

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding & Standardization
- Reviewed data for completeness and consistency  
- Standardized product and location names to eliminate duplicate records  
- Ensured accurate aggregation at SKU and location levels  

**Business Value:**  
Improved data accuracy and reliability for demand analysis.

---

### 2️⃣ SKU & Product-Level Demand Analysis
- Analyzed sales volume and revenue by SKU and product type  
- Identified high-demand and low-demand products  

**Business Value:**  
Helped prioritize forecasting and inventory planning for high-impact SKUs.

---

### 3️⃣ Location-Based Demand Analysis
- Compared demand patterns across locations  
- Identified regions with consistently higher or lower demand  

**Business Value:**  
Enabled location-specific forecasting instead of a uniform approach.

---

### 4️⃣ Seasonality & Trend Analysis
- Analyzed demand trends over time  
- Identified peak and low-demand periods  

**Business Value:**  
Improved preparedness for seasonal demand fluctuations.

---

### 5️⃣ Forecast Gap Identification
- Compared actual sales against stock levels  
- Identified under-forecasted SKUs (stock-out risk)  
- Identified over-forecasted SKUs (excess inventory risk)  

**Business Value:**  
Directly addressed the root causes of inventory imbalance.
