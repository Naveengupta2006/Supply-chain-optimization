📊 Supply Chain Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

Power BI | SQL | Business Analytics

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on solving a critical supply chain business problem — inaccurate demand forecasting — using data analysis and visualization.
The goal is to help businesses reduce stock-outs, excess inventory, and revenue loss by improving demand visibility across SKUs, products, and locations.

🚨 Business Problem

The organization was facing frequent inventory mismatches due to inaccurate demand forecasting across different SKUs and geographic locations.

Key Challenges:

Overstocking of low-demand products → higher holding costs

Stock-outs of high-demand products → lost sales and poor customer experience

No clear visibility into seasonal demand patterns

Demand varied significantly by location and product type, but forecasts were not customized

These issues negatively impacted inventory planning, supplier coordination, and overall supply chain efficiency.

🎯 Business Objective

To analyze historical sales and inventory data in order to:

Identify demand patterns and seasonality

Detect forecast gaps (under-forecasting & over-forecasting)

Support better inventory, production, and supply planning decisions

📂 Data Used

The analysis was performed using the following key data attributes:

Product Type, SKU

Number of Products Sold

Revenue Generated

Customer Demographics

Location

Availability & Stock Levels

🛠️ How the Problem Was Solved (Approach)
1️⃣ Data Understanding & Standardization

Reviewed sales, inventory, and product data for quality and consistency

Standardized product names and location names to eliminate duplicate demand records

Ensured accurate aggregation at SKU and location levels

Business Value:
Improved reliability of demand calculations and reporting.

2️⃣ Demand Analysis (SKU & Product Level)

Analyzed total units sold and revenue by SKU and product type

Identified high-demand (fast-moving) and low-demand (slow-moving) products

Business Value:
Helped focus forecasting and inventory planning on high-impact SKUs.

3️⃣ Location-Based Demand Analysis

Compared sales performance across different locations

Identified regions with consistently higher or lower demand

Business Value:
Enabled location-specific demand forecasting instead of a one-size-fits-all approach.

4️⃣ Seasonality & Trend Analysis

Studied sales trends over time to identify peak and low-demand periods

Highlighted seasonal products with fluctuating demand

Business Value:
Improved planning for seasonal spikes and reduced surprise stock-outs.

5️⃣ Forecast Gap Identification (Core Analysis)

Compared actual sales vs available stock levels

Identified:

Under-forecasted SKUs → Stock-out risk

Over-forecasted SKUs → Excess inventory

Business Value:
Directly addressed the root cause of inventory imbalance.

📈 Power BI Dashboard Highlights

The final insights were delivered through an interactive Power BI dashboard featuring:

Executive KPIs (Total Sales, Revenue, SKU Count)

Top & bottom SKUs by demand

Product category contribution analysis

Location-wise demand distribution

Monthly seasonality trends

Sales vs Stock comparison to identify forecast risks

💡 Business Impact

Improved demand forecasting accuracy

Reduced excess inventory and holding costs

Minimized stock-out risks and lost sales

Enabled data-driven inventory and supply planning

Improved customer satisfaction through better product availability
